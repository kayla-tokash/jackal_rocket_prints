I have not test printed this so please report issues

At scale, this supports up to 6" rockets. But it can be scaled up or down so long as you have the print space.

You will need to print:

- 2x fin_alignment_guillotine_Lbar.stl
- 1x fin_alignment_guillotine_box.stl
- 2x fin_alignment_guillotine_slide.stl

You will also need:
- 8-16 M5-Screws
