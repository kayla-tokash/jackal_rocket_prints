# 3D Printed STL File Repo
This is a public repo for me to share prints with The Rocketry Forum. 

I'll slowly add parts as I can.

Disclaimer: I am not responsible for anything that may happen while using my prints. Use your best judgement and stick to official NAR and Tripoli rules when constructing and flying rockets made from or using prints from this repo.
